Chunking

Chunking is a memory strategy that breaks down large amounts of information into smaller, manageable units or chunks, making it easier to remember, process, and understand. 
It is particularly useful in AI models with token or character limits and is commonly used in natural language processing tasks like summarization or translation.
Chunking can be based on characters, words, sentences, or semantic boundaries. 
A typical strategy is to define a fixed-size window and slide it through the text. 
Overlapping chunks may preserve context between segments. 
In AI, chunking is crucial for feeding large documents into models like GPT or Gemini, ensuring smooth handling of long inputs and preventing data loss. 
Effective chunking often relies on predefined rules or machine learning algorithms to ensure coherence. 
Chunking improves scalability and efficiency in processing pipelines and can be automated using scripts or specialized libraries. 
It is not limited to text but can also handle audio, video, and image data.
